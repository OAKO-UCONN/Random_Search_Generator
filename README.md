# Random_Search_Generator
Generating Traffic from random searches against google

## Check it out

I came across http://makeinternetnoise.com/index.html which generates random HTML traffic searches for privacy reasons. This was a nice and simple project but I wanted to expand this to test out HTML traffic generation for my own reasons and I want it to look like a bot, so why re-create the wheen I just modified that code for my own reasons. 

Everyone else is free to modify it as well, its not biggie just visit https://mgalde.github.io/Random_Search_Generator/ and play around

Also one last plug for http://makeinternetnoise.com/index.html it was a really awesome job and a important cause!!
